## What is this repo ðŸ¤¨
Here I've tried implementing cloud based file storage app during my Cloud Computing course at the University of Wroclaw

## What did I try and achieve ?
- Implemented simple server with upload/download/rm/ls endpoints that can be hosted on EC2 instance (simple server repo)
- Unfinished Web App with login menu and view files panel (didn't have time to finish it though, lack of FullStack skills gets me here)
- Worked out how the Docker can be used to build images and run containers on a single VPS instance
- Launched Github Actions Workflow for greeting new collaborators and building the app on a self-hosted runner 
- Set up AWS Elastic Computing Service with FarGate cluster that automatically deploys multiple container instances of a server
- Tried the thing above but with the EC2 autoscaling group. The task deployed but didn't work well (I didn't set up the instances right I guess or sth)
- Set up Github Actions Workflow that automatically builds and deploys the app to the ECS FarGate cluster!
