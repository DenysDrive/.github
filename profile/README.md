## What is this repo ðŸ¤¨
Here I've tried implementing cloud based file storage app during my Cloud Computing course at the University of Wroclaw

## What did I do during the ~20h spent on that proejct?
âœ¨ Implemented simple server with upload/download/rm/ls endpoints that can be hosted on VPS instance
âœ¨ Unfinished Web App with login menu and view files panel (didn't have time to finish it though, lack of FullStack skills gets me here)
âœ¨ Worked out how the Docker can be used to build images and run containers on a single VPS instance
âœ¨ Launched simple Github Actions for greeting new collaborators and testing whether the app builds without error on a self-hosted runner 
âœ¨ TODO
