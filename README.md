# .github
Self-made cloud file storage app!

# What I've done / tried / though of

- Implemented simple server with upload/download/rm/ls endpoints that can be hosted on VPS instance
- Unfinished Web App with login menu and view files panel (didn't have time to finish it though, lack of FullStack experince gets me here)
- Worked out how the Docker can be used to build images and run containers on a single VPS instance
